flight-game
===========

Flight was my first project using Ruby and Gosu. I created this small game as an end of semester 
assignment for Software Engineering. It was actually my first larger project (it is, larger than 
a calculator or other really simple, basic scripts).


I realize this is not a greatest game, but I guess it's enough for first game I made with pure programming.
